🚀 From Simple Chatbots to Intelligent Workflows

Experiments with LangChain Memories, Chains, and Gemini

Unlocking the next level of AI apps requires context and multi-step reasoning.
This repo contains my hands-on experiments with LangChain Memories and Chains, powered by Gemini, to build deeply interactive and intelligent AI workflows.

🔑 What’s Inside
🧠 Memories Implemented

BufferMemory → Full-context customer support chats.

BufferWindowMemory → Lightweight FAQ bot (last 3 messages only).

TokenBufferMemory → Summarization bot that avoids token/context limits.

SummaryMemory → Assistant that turns long convos into recap notes.

🔗 Chains Built

LLMChain → Resume → Professional Summary.

SimpleSequentialChain → Topic → Outline → Blog Post.

SequentialChain → (Resume + Job Desc) → Tailored Cover Letter.

RouterChain → Auto-route customer queries to the right department.
